            Corruption is an anti‐social attitude awarding improper privileges contrary to legal and moral norms, and impairs the authorities’ capacity to secure the welfare of all citizens. Corruption is a constant phenomenon in Nigeria. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to corruption since the independence.[1][2] In 2018, the country ranked 144th in the 180 countries listed [3] in Transparency International's Corruption Index (with Somalia, at 180th, being the most corrupt, and Denmark the least).[4][5][6] 
Nigerian politicians find themselves in a strong position of power and wealth due to their connections with the oil and gas industries in Nigeria. These gas industries are under the control of the State-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC). Oil and gas exports account for over 90% of all Nigerian export revenues.[7] While many politicians own or have shares in these industries, tax revenues from the energy sector are diminished and the benefits of Nigeria's energy wealth is not evenly distributed throughout the country with Lagos State benefitting disproportionately.[8] Oil and gas revenues therefore account for the vast majority of the federal budget and the salaries of government officials. Vote rigging by political parties in elections is widespread and corruption is endemic within government. Business arrangements and family loyalties dominate governmental appointments paving the way for politicians, officials and their business associates who together make up the ruling elite to ensure that they all become wealthy through behind the scenes agreements and the awarding of profitable contracts to favoured supporters.[citation needed][9] In 2018 many Government employees received annual salaries in excess of $1 million. Corruption runs through every level of Nigerian government. From massive contract fraud at the top, through petty bribery, money laundering schemes, embezzlement and seizing salaries from fake workers, it is estimated that corruption within the state apparatus costs the country billions of dollars every year.[10]

        <p>CORRUPTION IN EDUCATIONAL SECTOR</p>
        <hr />
        Corruption has also contributed immensely to the fallen standard of education in Nigeria, it has jeopardize the quality of education from primary to tertiary level, teachers, school administrators parents, students and all other stakeholders are involved in the ills of corruption.

Corruption in primary and secondary education affects policy making and planning, school management and procurement, and teacher conduct. ... Corruption contributes to poor education outcomes. Diversion of school funds robs schools of resources, while nepotism and favouritism can put unqualified teachers in classrooms.
At school level, corruption occurs in the form of bribes paid by parents to ensure access, good grades and graduation. In a broader sense, a bias against pupils on ethnic or gender grounds (i.e. the bypassing of objective student assessment criteria) also constitutes an abuse of power, i.e. an act of corruption.
Corruption reduces the infrastructure of a company as well as the effectiveness of public investments. The company may lose business if corruption and bribery is exposed, potentially leading to economic losses, job cuts and instability.

      <p>PROBLEMS OF CORRUPTION IN EDUCATIONAL SECTOR</p> 
      <hr /> 
      Education sector corruption erodes social trust, worsens inequality, and sabotages development. Types of corruption in elementary-secondary education range from academic cheating to bribery and nepotism in teaching appointments to bid-rigging in procurement of textbooks and supplies. After identifying priority problems in a locally led process, practitioners can use transparency- and accountability-promoting tools to tackle corrupt behaviours and the incentives underlying them.
      Main points

      <ul>

      <li>Corruption in education threatens the well-being of society because it erodes social trust and worsens inequality. It sabotages development by undermining the formation of educated, competent, and ethical individuals for future leadership and the labour force.</li>
      <li>Corruption in primary and secondary education affects policy making and planning, school management and procurement, and teacher conduct. Examples include cheating and other academic violations; bribery, nepotism, and favouritism in school admissions, teacher appointments, and licensing of education facilities; bid-rigging in the procurement of textbooks and school supplies; diversion of funds and equipment; teacher absenteeism; and exploitation of schoolchildren for sex or unpaid labour.</li>
      <li>Corruption contributes to poor education outcomes. Diversion of school funds robs schools of resources, while nepotism and favouritism can put unqualified teachers in classrooms. Bid-rigging may result in textbooks and supplies of inferior quality. When families must pay bribes for services, this puts poor students at a disadvantage and reduces equal access to education. Teachers’ demands for sex may cause girl students to drop out of school.</li>
      <li>Features of a country’s education system and political economy often create incentives for corruption. Sector-specific approaches to anti-corruption reform enable stakeholders to target specific instances of corrupt behaviour and the incentives underlying them. </li>
      <li>Assessing corruption risks and designing mitigation strategies must be a locally owned and locally led process. Context mapping, using tools such as political economy analysis, power and influence analysis, and the Integrity of Education Systems (INTES) approach, can help practitioners spot corruption problems and identify likely allies or opponents of reform.</li>
      <li>stakeholders should engage in dialogue and consensus building to agree on which problems to prioritise, taking into account their urgency and the political feasibility of different anti-corruption strategies. </li>
      <li>anti-corruption strategies in education can make use of (a) transparency-promoting tools, such as ICTs, participatory budgeting, Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys, and social audits, and (b) accountability-promoting tools, such as performance-based contracting, teacher codes of conduct, community monitoring, complaints mechanisms, salary reform, procurement reform, and public financial management reforms.</li>
      <li>Monitoring, evaluation, and learning should be built into anti-corruption reforms so that measures can adapt to changing contextual realities.</li>
      <li>Including values, integrity, and anti-corruption education in school curricula is a long-term strategy mandated by the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.</li>
      <li>Bilateral development agencies can support participatory sector planning processes that include corruption risks as part of education sector situation analyses. They can support technical assistance for political economy assessments, systems analysis, and other approaches to assessing corruption risks. Assessments should build upon synergies with gender analysis and human rights–based approaches to ensure that anti-corruption measures address aspects of inequity and vulnerability.</li>
